# custom-wordle

## About

This is my third portfolio project for the _nology consultancy course. This project was designed to demonstrate knowledge of JavaScript and integrating it with HTML and CSS.

The requirements for this project were as follows:

- Build a game using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript
- The project should be managed with Git and hosted on GitHub Pages
- Use BEM naming in conjunction with Sass for readability in styling
- A minimum of 25 commits should be made to the repository
- Take a mobile first approach
- When copying code from sources online: if you can't explain it, you can't use it
- You must use click or keypress events in JavaScript to trigger the events in the game. (No refreshing to start the game again!)

For this project I decided to make a Wordle clone but with a twist: the player is able to choose the number of letters the word contains, as well as the number of guesses they have to correctly guess the word.
